#Now we will learn how to access items in a list.
#It works very similar to working with strings.

list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(list1[1])

>>>2

#Again the index starts at 0.
#Some thing special in Python is, that the elements of a list don't have to be the same data type.
#So you can mix strings, numbers and even lists with each other.
#What is the output of the following?

list2 = ["Hello",1,2,[5,7,0],"Thomas"]
print(list2[1] + list2[3][1])

####################To follow up#########################
#Take list2 as given.
#Try to produce the following output with it:
#Tipp: The exclamation mark is not included in the string in the list!

>>>Hello Thomas!
