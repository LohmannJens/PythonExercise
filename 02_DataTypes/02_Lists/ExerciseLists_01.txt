#Now we will get used to the next data type.
#Lists are very useful in python, because it allows to save different data types together.
#A list is initialised by the command list().

list1 = list()
print(list1)

>>>[]

#We created an empty list.
#If you already know, what will be in the list you can also initialise it by

list2 = [1,2,3,4,5]

#To add new elements at the end of a list .append() can be used
#To remove them .pop() is used
#To add them at a specific position .insert(position,element)
#Try to follow and understand these expressions:

list2.append(6)
list2.insert(3,9)
list2.pop()
list2.pop(0)
list2.pop(3)

#Which elements are still in list2
