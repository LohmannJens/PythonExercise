#Now we will learn our first data type, strings.
#We already used a string in the Hello World Exercise.

string = "Thomas"

#Thomas is a string, which is asigned to the variable a.
#We can use brackets [] to access specific positions in a string.
#Try the following:

print(string[1])

You will get this output:

>>>h

#What did you expect?
#In Python (and also other programming languages) strings start with the index 0.
#You can also access more than one letter of a string.
#Try:

print(string[0:3])

#To get the last character of a string  you can use the following trick:

print(string[-1:])

###########################To follow up###################################
#Try to print every second letter of the following string.
#Start with the "!" and go backwards.

string = "Python is fun!"
