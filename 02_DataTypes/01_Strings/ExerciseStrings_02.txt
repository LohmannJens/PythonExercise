#Now we will learn how to connect different strings.
#The first method is a simple mathematical expression

string1 = "Hello"
string2 = " World!"
string3 = string1 + string2

print(string3)

>>>Hello World!

#Now try the following script and explain what is happening:

string1 = "Hello"
string2 = " World!"
string1 += string2

print(string1)
