#We will continue with the second exercise.
#Now we will learn how to declare and use variables.
#A variable is asigned by using the equal operator "=".

a = "Hello World!"
print(a)

>>>Hello World!

#Now the string "Hello World!" was saved as variable a.

#Sometime you want to have only a bit of the output as a variable.
#For example if you write letters to different persons, you just want to change the name.
#To reveive this you can use the format() fuction which works as followed:

name = "Thomas"
print("Hello {}!".format(name))

>>>Hello Thomas!

#"{}" is used as a placeholder and is filled by the variable in the format() function.
########################To follow up#############################
#Try to greet two persons (Thomas & Benjamin) with the same expression.
#The Output should look like the following:

>>>Hello Thomas, Hello Benjamin!
