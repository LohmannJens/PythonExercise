#We will right now start with your first exercise.
#Our goal is to have a first output and be able to write things on the screen.
#For that the function "print()" is used.
#If you want to write "Hello World!" you have to use quotation marks (" ").
#Try it and type the following in your script:

print("Hello World!")

#If you run the script the output should be the following:

>>>Hello World!

#Congratulations! You wrote your first own code.
